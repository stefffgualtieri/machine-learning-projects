## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hello! I'm **Stefano Gualtieri**, a Master’s degree candidate in **Computer Science** at the **University of Milano-Bicocca**, specializing in **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**.

I’m passionate about **AI research, machine learning and deep learning**, with a focus on:
- 🧠 **Neural Networks (NNs)**  
- 🐺 **Meta-heuristic optimization algorithms**  
- 🔍 **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and language model evaluation  

My background combines a **Physics BSc** (Occhialini Department, Bicocca) with a strong interest in computational modeling, giving me a solid foundation in both theory and implementation.

Currently, I’m working on my master’s thesis, where I develop **custom optimization strategies for training SNNs in PyTorch**, exploring biologically inspired and energy-efficient computation.
